[Educational DP Contest](https://atcoder.jp/contests/dp) consists of 26 educational problems in dynamic programming. 

Each problem is a bit more difficult then the previous one, either because of the idea necessary to solve it or because of the coding difficulty.
Later problems use a collection of ideas introduced in earlier problems.
